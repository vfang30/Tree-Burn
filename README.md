A high school project originally located in a private repository belonging to the school.

The project was completed in April 2023 during my senior year.

The burn trees executable will generate a forest of trees (represented by an @) and a fire that spreads to trees one unit away. The program terminates once all the fires stop and will print the amount of ticks it took for the fire to stop.

The user can provide values for the height, width, and density of the forest before running (if they don't default settings are applied).
